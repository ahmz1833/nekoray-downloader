# Nekoray VPN Installation Script

This repository provides a Bash script to automatically download, install, and configure the **Nekoray VPN** client on Linux.

> ‚öôÔ∏è **Note:** This script is an installer for [throneproj/nekoray](https://github.com/throneproj/nekoray).

## üì¶ What it does

- Downloads and installs the latest (or specified) Nekoray release under `~/Apps/nekoray`
- Creates a launcher script (`~/.local/bin/nekolaunch`) to run Nekoray as root
- Creates a desktop application entry for `nekolaunch`
- Applies some configuration and adds some subscriptions for first use

> **Note that for first use, you must press Ctrl+U (Update Subscription) in each group to get the list of configs**

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Usage Notes
- You can select **"Bypass Iran"** in the Routing menu. It will directly bypass Iranian traffic and will not be proxied.
- Since the application runs as root, you must use **Tun Mode** for routing traffic. The **System Proxy** option will have no effect.
- If you need to use proxy mode instead of tunneling, you'll need to manually configure the proxy in your applications to use:
  - **Protocol:** SOCKS5
  - **Address:** 127.0.0.1:2080

## üîß Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following tools installed:
- `curl`
- `jq`
